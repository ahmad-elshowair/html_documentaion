_I can see a main element with a corresponding id="main-doc", which contains the page's main content (technical documentation)._

## User Story 2:

Within the #main-doc element, I can see several section elements, each with a class of main-section. There should be a minimum of 5.\*

## User Story 3:

_The first element within each .main-section should be a header element which contains text that describes the topic of that section._

## User Story 4:

_Each section element with the class of main-section should also have an id that corresponds with the text of each header contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The section that contains the header "JavaScript and Java" should have a corresponding id="JavaScript_and_Java")._

## User Story 13:

_When I click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the main-doc element (e.g. If I click on a nav-link element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a section element that has that id and contains the corresponding header._
